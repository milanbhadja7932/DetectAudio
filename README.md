# DetectAudio

# Problem Statement
This dataset consists of various audio files with different emotions. Your goal is to create a classifier that can predict the emotion of any given speech with an input of an audio file.

# Requirements
 -> numpy<br>
 -> matplotlib<br>

 -> keras<br>
 -> sklearn<br>
 -> tqdm<br>
 
# Dataset
  we have different types actor audio.
 
 Speakers
    --------------------------------------
    'Actor 1', 'Actor 2', 'Actor 3' and 'Actor 4' are four male speakers

       Audio files consist of audio WAV files sampled at 44.1 kHz

       There are 15 sentences for each of the 3 emotion categories.
       The initial letter(s) of the file name represents the emotion class, and the following digits represent the sentence number.
       The letters 'a', 'h' and 'sa' represent 'anger', 'happiness' and 'sadness' emotion classes respectively. 
       E.g., 'a03.wav' is the 3rd anger sentence.
